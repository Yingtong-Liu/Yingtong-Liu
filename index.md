### **About me**
I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Certik](https://www.certik.com/), a leading company in Web3 security.

With extensive experience in software security, program analysis, operating systems, and blockchain security, I am passionate about leveraging automated program analysis techniques to enhance the security and reliability of software systems. My focus includes securing the critical implementations that power everyday technology, with a particular emphasis on operating systems. Additionally, I have a strong interest in designing and building high-performance, secure systems and infrastructures.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Irvine, advised by [Prof. Ardalan Amiri Sani](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ardalan/). My research explores the intersection of operating systems and security. My work has been published in top-tier conferences, including ACM EuroSys, ACM MobiCom, and ACM ASPLOS. I have a B.Sc. degree from the Department of Computer Science of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Before coming to UCI, I worked with [Prof. Chen Tian](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/index.htm) on datacenter networks.

### **My cat**

[Taco](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1EOdUHqBvzgyymPQ0aS11SF9LzkQnP70I) was born on 09/17/2017. I adopted her from [Irvine Animal Care Center](https://www.cityofirvine.org/irvine-animal-care-center) when she was 3 months old. She is both shy and naughty.
