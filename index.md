### **About me**

I receivved my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in August 2022, advised by [Prof. Ardalan Amiri Sani](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ardalan/). I came from China and received my B.Sc. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Before coming to UCI, I worked with [Prof. Chen Tian](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/index.htm) on datacenter networks. My hometown is Shangqiu, Henan Province, China.

My research focused on the intersection of security, operating systems, and programming analysis. I am excited about applying programming analysis techniques to secure and improve the implementations of complex softwares people use day to day, with operating system as one example. I am now working on using automation to improve Web3 security. 

Aside from work, I enjoy running, hiking, writing, and listening to all kinds of music.

### **My cat**

[Taco](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1EOdUHqBvzgyymPQ0aS11SF9LzkQnP70I) was born on 09/17/2017. I adopted her from [Irvine Animal Care Center](https://www.cityofirvine.org/irvine-animal-care-center) when she was 3 months old. She is shy and naughty at the same time.
