### **Yingtong Liu**

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), working with [Prof. Ardalan Amiri Sani](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ardalan/). I received my B.Sc. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China. Before coming to UCI, I worked with [Prof. Chen Tian](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/index.htm) on datacenter networks. My interests are in the intersection of operating systems, security, and programming analysis. I enjoy building reliable systems to solve realistic problems in both software engineering and operating systems.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Yingtong-Liu/Yingtong-Liu.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
